					This is where you would introduce yourself. You might include links to things <a href="//google.com">RANDOM LINK TO GOOGLE</a>. You might have links to outside websites or things like your resume.
					
					You might also talk about groups that you have worked with (and perhaps link to them), and/or put your interests here!
					
					<p>The goal is to give potential employers some idea of who you are (to convince them that you are skilled, professional, and personable!) 
					<p> I'm a Master's Student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. I have a Bachelor's degree in statistics and psychology from University of California, Los Angeles. My past experiences include working as a research assistant at Dieting, Stress, and Health (DiSH) Lab supervised by A. Janet Tomiyama, Ph.D.

			                <p> I'm a Master's Student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. I have a Bachelor's degree in mathematics from Pomona College. My past experiences include an internship at Genentech where I developed and employed methodology for differential gene expression testing using paraffin embedded tissue; as well as a collaborative experience with the <a href="https://www.cff.org/researchers/therapeutics-development-network"> Therapeutics Development Network </a> supporting the design of randomized interventional trials for cystic fibrosis. </p>
					
					<p> I am broadly interested in Biostatistics and Data Science, and enjoy the process of engaging domain science, statistical models and programmatic data analysis. </p>
